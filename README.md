## Testing

## Deploying

## Assumptions

- Set labels as tiny colored circles with popup to display its name. Tags were really ugly, maybe a better solution can be found later.
- The users must be able to filter by status, so it was added a group button with the options `All`, `Open` and `Closed`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
